## Files in the Repository

### Final Notebook and Output
- **`IncomePred-Final.ipynb`**: The final notebook containing the implementation of Random Forest and XGBoost models. Based on the results, XGBoost was selected as the better-performing model.
- **`submission_xgb_final.csv`**: The final output file submitted to Kaggle, generated using the XGBoost model.

### Mid-Term Work
- **`IncomePred-MidTerm.ipynb`**: The notebook created during the mid-term phase, where baseline models were implemented using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
- **`submission_logreg.csv`**: Output file generated by the Logistic Regression baseline model.
- **`submission_tree.csv`**: Output file generated by the Decision Tree baseline model.

### Additional Outputs
- **`submission_rf_final.csv`**: Output file generated by the Random Forest model in the final notebook.

## Overview of Progress

1. **Mid-Term Work**:
   - Implemented two baseline models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
   - Evaluated the models and generated two submission files: `submission_logreg.csv` and `submission_tree.csv`.

2. **Final Work**:
   - Built upon the mid-term work by implementing Random Forest and XGBoost models in the final notebook (`IcomePred-Final.ipynb`).
   - Compared the outputs and concluded that **XGBoost** was the better model for this task.
   - Generated the final submission file: `submission_xgb_final.csv`.

---

## Conclusion
- The repository showcases the iterative progress from baseline models to more advanced methods.
- The final submission file, `submission_xgb_final.csv`, represents the best-performing model (XGBoost) for the competition task.
